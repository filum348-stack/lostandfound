## Project Description

Smart Lost & Found AI is a web-based platform that allows users to report lost or found items with images.
It helps connect people who lost items with those who found them through a simple and user-friendly interface.

---

## The Problem Statement

People often lose personal belongings in schools, colleges, and public places.
There is no simple digital system to report and track lost or found items efficiently.

---

## The Solution

Our solution is a web application where users can:

* Upload lost or found items with images
* View items in real time
* Confirm ownership and remove items

This creates a centralized digital lost-and-found system.
